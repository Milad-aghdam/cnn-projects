## Project Overview

This repository is designed to demonstrate the step-by-step learning of Convolutional Neural Networks using various popular datasets. Starting with simpler datasets like MNIST and progressing to more complex tasks like image segmentation and object detection, each project builds upon previous knowledge and showcases key concepts in computer vision.

### 1. MNIST Digit Classification

The first project in this series uses a CNN to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the **MNIST** dataset. This project is designed to introduce the basics of CNNs for image classification.

### 2. CIFAR-10 Image Classification

CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 images (32x32 pixels) divided into 10 classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Each class has 6,000 images.

### 3. Cats vs. Dogs Classification
 This dataset contains 25,000 images of cats and dogs. our goal is to classify whether an image contains a cat or a dog.
