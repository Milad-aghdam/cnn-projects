## Project Overview

This repository is designed to demonstrate the step-by-step learning of Convolutional Neural Networks using various popular datasets. Starting with simpler datasets like MNIST and progressing to more complex tasks like image segmentation and object detection, each project builds upon previous knowledge and showcases key concepts in computer vision.

### 1. MNIST Digit Classification

The first project in this series uses a CNN to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the **MNIST** dataset. This project is designed to introduce the basics of CNNs for image classification.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to run any of the projects:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **PyTorch**
- **torchvision**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**

You can install all required packages with the following command:


``` bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
